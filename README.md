*Restaurant “5 minuti”* opened in July 2020 in Ålesund center. They make fresh, high-quality Italian food, including Pizza al taglio and delicious pastries.

5 minuti is a growing business and have always lots of ideas for development. One of possible extensions that they see for their business: a booking system where people could book a table in advance.

The project for bachelor students would be to create a table booking system as a mobile app (or a mobile-friendly website), plus a physical interface in the restaurant allowing customers to see which tables are free and which are reserved.

This project involves a lot of creativity, the students need to come up with innovative solutions. The owners of the restaurant have a general vision: an intuitive, simple and clear booking system. The part of the journey is to find out how to do it – which technological options are out there, what
would users prefer, etc.
